Since IIIT HYDERABAD is a new Institute, does it relax the requirements for faculty positions?
        <div id=faq1 class="answer">
IIIT-H places great emphasis on the high quality of the faculty it hires. As the Institute is in its rapid development phase, these are the people who will lay the seeds for IIIT-H to grow into an institution of exceptional repute, and the Institute is very selective in its recruitment and will lookto hire only the best faculty.
</div></li>
        <li class="question fa" onclick="toggle('faq2',this)"><span id="faq2Char" class='MoreLess'>+</span>I enjoy teaching and I am an excellent teacher, but research is not a big priority for me; (or conversely) I am passionate about research, and I find that teaching gets in the way. Is IIIT-H the right place for me?
        <div id="faq2" class="answer">One activity cannot be discounted at the expense of the other. At IIIT-H teaching and research go hand in hand. Excellent research will inform teaching, and enable the Institute to graduate students at the forefront of knowledge.</div></li>
        <li class="question" onclick="toggle('faq3',this)"><span id="faq3Char" class='MoreLess'>+</span>I am living outside India; do I have to come down to IIIT-H for an interview?
        <div id="faq3" class="answer">IIIT-H strongly prefers that candidates invited for an interview physically visit the campus as it gives the candidate a chance to observe the growth of IIIT-H in person and also helps IIIT-H to evaluate the compatibility of the candidate with the institute. Only in exceptional cases does IIIT-H conduct formal interviews and presentations through Skype</div></li>
        <li class="question" onclick="toggle('faq4',this)"><span id="faq4Char" class='MoreLess'>+</span>I will be defending my thesis soon (I don’t have the PhD degree yet), can I still apply?

        <li class="question" onclick="toggle('faq7',this)"><span id="faq7Char" class='MoreLess'>+</span>What are the limitations of being on “contract” compared to being on the “regular” track?
        <div id="faq7" class="answer">To expedite the hiring process, faculty members may be appointed on contract by a Standing Committee instead of the Selection Committee. The appointments made through the Standing Committee will be for a maximum period of two years. Candidates with less than three years of post - PhD experience are appointed on contract regardless of whether the appointment is through a Standing Committee or Selection Committee. Those appointed through the Standing Committ ee must be approved for continuation in regular positions by the Selection Committee in due course. Benefits for regular and contract appointments are generally the same.

        <div id="faq10" class="answer">Merit of the candidate is the main consideration, and IIIT-H neither gives preference nor discriminates in hiring spouses. The Institute is located in an economically vibrant city and there are many opportunities for spouses in the neighborhood.</div></li>
